{"id":"PokePoke-03q5","title":"Add desktop app build verification to pre-commit hooks","description":"Add a pre-commit check that verifies the desktop app builds successfully (vite build) when desktop files are staged. Currently check-build.ps1 only validates Python syntax. The check should: (1) Detect staged desktop/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,css,html} files. (2) Skip if none are staged. (3) Run 'npm run build' in the desktop/ directory (which runs tsc -b \u0026\u0026 vite build). (4) Fail the commit if the build fails. This catches import errors, missing modules, and Vite config issues that tsc alone might miss. Can potentially be combined with the type-check into a single build step since 'npm run build' already includes tsc -b.","notes":"Added desktop build verification to check-build pre-commit hook","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"pokepoke_quantum_raichu_ad70","owner":"ameliapayne@microsoft.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T21:06:09.3989409-08:00","created_by":"Amelia Payne","updated_at":"2026-02-12T11:37:26.5246083-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-12T11:37:26.5246083-08:00","labels":["desktop-ui","tests"]}

Update last_run after agent completes successfully\n\nCurrent behavior: Agents may never run if the total never hits a multiple of their frequency, or may run more often than intended if the modulo happens to align.\n\nExpected behavior: Each agent respects its configured frequency based on actual work items processed since it last ran.\n\nExample: If Janitor (frequency=2) last ran at item 5, it should next run at item 7, then 9, etc. Not at items where 7 % 2 == 0 or 9 % 2 == 0.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"ameliapayne@microsoft.com","created_at":"2026-02-12T17:39:22.7459286-08:00","created_by":"Amelia Payne","updated_at":"2026-02-12T17:39:22.7459286-08:00","labels":["validation"]}

(3) On startup, load historical stats and use them to inform model selection (e.g. weight toward models with higher success rates).

With parallel agents, multiple threads will print() simultaneously and their output will interleave into one panel. Fix: Create an AgentContext dataclass that holds per-agent state: agent_id, work_item, log_buffer, cwd. Use threading.local() to store the active AgentContext per thread. Modify PrintRedirect.write() to read the current thread's AgentContext and route to the correct panel/buffer. Each agent thread sets its AgentContext at start via a context manager. The orchestrator thread keeps its own context. This replaces the current global ui.active_target pattern. Key files: textual_ui.py (PrintRedirect class, ~line 40), textual_app.py (message routing).

{"id":"PokePoke-gdsa","title":"Merge queue coordinator for serialized worktree merges","description":"When parallel agents complete work simultaneously, they must not merge to the target branch concurrently - git push would fail with 'non-fast-forward' errors, and concurrent merge conflict resolution would corrupt the worktree. Build a MergeQueue class in a new module (or extend coordination.py) that serializes merges: (1) Agents call merge_queue.submit(worktree_path, item) when their work passes the gate. (2) The queue processes one merge at a time using the existing merge_worktree_to_dev() from worktree_finalization.py. (3) Between merges, run git pull --rebase in the next worktree to incorporate the previous merge before attempting the next. (4) If a merge fails due to conflicts, the queue can re-run the gate agent in that worktree after rebasing, or flag the item for retry. (5) Use a threading.Queue + dedicated merge worker thread, or acquire_lock('merge') from coordination.py (PokePoke-lgzs). The merge queue thread should respect shutdown signals. This extends the file-based merge lock (PokePoke-0xlm) with in-process queuing for the parallel case.

The specific failure shows: (1) Agent makes changes to multiple files (package.json, requirements.txt, src/pokepoke/*.py), (2) Auto-commit is attempted but pre-commit hooks fail, (3) Build check reports 'No Python files found' which suggests the pre-commit hook is running in the wrong directory (worktree) or can't find Python files from the worktree context, (4) A cleanup agent is invoked to fix validation errors but this likely also fails or loops. This wastes significant tokens (4.3M+ input tokens per run) with no committed output. Possible causes: (1) Pre-commit hooks don't work correctly from worktree directories, (2) The janitor prompt doesn't instruct the agent to commit incrementally during work, (3) The janitor makes too many changes across too many files in a single pass, making it hard to pass quality gates.

The sync itself succeeds (3-way merge completes, import completes) but the final JSONL export fails because another process holds a lock on issues.jsonl. Likely causes: (1) The beads daemon has an open file handle on issues.jsonl, (2) Multiple PokePoke agents running concurrently cause file contention on .beads/issues.jsonl, (3) Windows file locking prevents atomic rename while another reader has the file open, (4) Antivirus or indexing service holding a transient lock.

Meanwhile, orchestrator.py uses the new `session_stats.record_agent_stats()` which DOES acquire SessionStats._lock. These two callers use different locks to protect the same data — a textbook race condition. Fix: Replace `aggregate_stats(session_stats, result)` on line 210 with `session_stats.record_agent_stats(result)`.\n\n2. **No tests for any new thread-safe methods**: The 9 new methods (record_completion, record_agent_run, record_agent_stats, record_retries, record_model_completion, record_janitor_lines_removed, set_starting_beads_stats, set_ending_beads_stats, snapshot) and the SessionStatsSnapshot class have zero test coverage. test_types.py was not updated. At minimum, unit tests should verify: (a) basic functionality of each method, (b) input validation (negative values, unknown agent types), (c) snapshot returns frozen copy, (d) thread-safety under concurrent access.\n\nMinor issue: maintenance_scheduler.py:192-193 has redundant double-locking (self._stats_lock wrapping record_agent_run which internally acquires SessionStats._lock).

{"id":"PokePoke-mj71","title":"Replace os.chdir() with subprocess cwd parameter for agent isolation","description":"CRITICAL BLOCKER for parallel agents. Currently workflow.py and agent_runner.py use os.chdir() to switch into worktree directories before invoking Copilot. os.chdir() is process-global - changing CWD in one thread affects ALL threads. This makes it impossible to run two agents concurrently in different worktrees. Fix: (1) In workflow.py process_work_item(), remove os.chdir(worktree_path) and instead pass cwd=worktree_path to invoke_copilot_sdk(). (2) In copilot_sdk.py invoke_copilot_async(), accept an optional cwd parameter and pass it to the CopilotChat session or subprocess. (3) In agent_runner.py _run_worktree_agent(), remove os.chdir() calls and pass cwd to invoke_copilot_cli(). (4) In agent_runner.py run_gate_agent(), pass cwd to the subprocess call.

{"id":"PokePoke-mkaz","title":"Singleton guard for maintenance agents in parallel mode","description":"Maintenance agents (beta_tester, janitor, backlog_cleanup, worktree_cleanup) must not run multiple instances simultaneously - they either modify shared state (janitor cleans worktrees) or produce duplicate work (beta_tester files same issues twice). In the current sequential model this is impossible, but with parallel agents, the orchestrator might trigger maintenance from multiple completing agents at once. Design: (1) Create a MaintenanceScheduler class that owns maintenance scheduling. It replaces the current inline counter checks in orchestrator.py _run_periodic_maintenance(). (2) Use a dict of threading.Lock per agent type (or try_lock from coordination.py). (3) When an agent completes and maintenance is due, MaintenanceScheduler.maybe_run(agent_type) acquires the lock. If already held, skip with a log message. (4) Track run counts atomically with threading-safe counters. (5) Tech Debt and Code Review (beads-only, no worktree, no merging) CAN run in parallel and don't need the guard. Key files: orchestrator.py (_run_periodic_maintenance), agent_runner.py (run_maintenance_agent).

The tests need to either: (a) mock at the maintenance_scheduler module path instead, or (b) mock the scheduler's delegation entry point. Additionally, a .pokepoke/locks/maintenance-janitor.lock file was incorrectly committed to git (lock files are runtime artifacts).

{"id":"PokePoke-n14t","title":"Gate agent loops when work item is already completed or unnecessary","description":"When a work item has already been completed on the main branch (e.g., the fix was merged via another branch or the issue no longer applies), the gate agent enters an infinite retry loop. The work agent correctly reports there's nothing to do, but the gate agent rejects it because it doesn't see new commits or changes, triggering another retry cycle. This wastes tokens and blocks the orchestrator. The gate agent prompt needs to be updated to: (1) Check if the work described in the beads item has already been completed on the main/dev branch before rejecting. (2) Compare the current state of the codebase against what the work item asks for - if the fix/feature already exists, approve and close the item. (3) Distinguish between 'agent failed to do the work' vs 'work was already done and no changes are needed'. (4) If the item is genuinely no longer needed (stale, duplicate, or already fixed), the gate agent should approve with a note that the item should be closed as already-resolved rather than forcing another retry. Current behavior: gate rejects -\u003e retry -\u003e agent says nothing to do -\u003e gate rejects -\u003e infinite loop.

{"id":"PokePoke-oapy","title":"Atomic work item claiming to prevent parallel thread races","description":"With multiple agent threads selecting work items simultaneously, there is a TOCTOU race in the current claiming flow: Thread A calls bd ready, sees item X is available. Thread B also calls bd ready, also sees item X. Both call assign_and_sync_item() for X - one succeeds, one wastes a worktree creation. Current mitigation: assign_and_sync_item() in beads_management.py checks the assignee field before assigning, but two threads could pass that check simultaneously. Fix: (1) Use acquire_lock('claim') from coordination.py around the entire select-and-claim sequence. (2) Better: maintain an in-process set of claimed_item_ids (protected by a threading.Lock) that threads check before attempting to claim. Thread adds item ID to the set atomically, then calls bd update --assign. If bd update fails, remove from set. (3) The select_work_item() function in work_item_selection.py should accept a claimed_ids set parameter and filter those out of the ready list before presenting options. This is complementary to PokePoke-n5yu (file-based claim lock for cross-process) but handles the in-process multi-thread case more efficiently.

(2) Give the ThreadPoolExecutor time to drain - cancel pending futures, let running agents reach a checkpoint. (3) Wait for the merge queue to finish its current merge (don't abort mid-merge or the worktree is left dirty). (4) Increase watchdog timeout proportionally to active agents (e.g., 5s + 3s per active agent) since multiple agents need graceful wind-down. (5) The Copilot SDK async wait loop in copilot_sdk.py already checks is_shutting_down() every 1s, so agent threads will notice quickly. (6) Add executor.shutdown(wait=True, cancel_futures=True) call in the shutdown path. (7) Ensure merge_queue.shutdown() is called to drain the merge worker.

If a work item repeatedly times out (e.g., due to a slow/stuck agent), each timeout triggers a new recursive call with the same parameters, guaranteeing the same timeout will be hit again. This will eventually cause a Python RecursionError (stack overflow), crashing the orchestrator.\n\nAdditionally, the recursive call reuses the same worktree without cleanup, accumulating state across retries.\n\nFix: Replace the recursion with a while-loop and retry counter. Add a max_retries parameter (e.g., 3) and track attempts. On exceeding max retries, fail the item instead of recursing. This also makes timeout restart behavior explicit and testable.\n\nKey file: src/pokepoke/workflow.py, lines 101-107\nSeverity: High - can crash the orchestrator process","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"ameliapayne@microsoft.com","created_at":"2026-02-12T14:04:15.1516662-08:00","created_by":"Amelia Payne","updated_at":"2026-02-12T17:21:28.7833807-08:00","labels":["orchestrator","reliability"]}

If stash pop fails due to a conflict, the .beads/ changes are lost in the stash and the working directory may be left in an inconsistent state.\n\nThe comment on line 339 says 'beads will re-sync anyway' but this assumption is fragile - if the beads daemon is not running, or if the stashed changes included manual edits, data is silently lost. Furthermore, stale stash entries accumulate over time (one per failed pop), causing 'git stash list' pollution and potential confusion.\n\nFix: (1) Log a warning when stash pop fails so operators can investigate.
