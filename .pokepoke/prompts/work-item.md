🤖 **AUTONOMOUS MODE: NEVER ASK FOR PERMISSION**
- You are operating autonomously - proceed directly with implementation
- NEVER ask "Would you like me to proceed?" or "Should I continue?"
- NEVER wait for confirmation before fixing issues
- If you identify a problem, FIX IT IMMEDIATELY
- If you see a clear solution, IMPLEMENT IT IMMEDIATELY
- Only ask questions if requirements are truly ambiguous

Please implement this task according to the project guidelines and best practices. Make sure to:
1. Follow the coding standards
2. Add appropriate tests
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Commit your code changes with a descriptive message
5. Update beads items as needed - beads changes sync automatically via 'bd sync'
6. When done and all validation passes, merge and close your worktree

Work independently and autonomously. Report completion when done.
