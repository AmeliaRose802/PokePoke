## What is the GitHub Copilot SDK?

The GitHub Copilot SDK is a set of libraries and tools that allow developers to integrate GitHub Copilot's AI-powered code completion and automation features into their own applications, editors, or workflows. It provides APIs for invoking Copilot's code suggestions, managing sessions, and interacting programmatically with Copilot's capabilities beyond the standard editor plugin experience.
