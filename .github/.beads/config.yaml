# Beads Configuration
# See https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/docs/WORKTREES.md
#
# Note: Most configuration is managed via 'bd config' commands or 'bd migrate'
# The actual sync.branch configuration is stored in metadata.json, not here.
# This file is kept for documentation purposes and future YAML-based config.
#
# Configured settings (managed by bd migrate sync):
# - sync.branch: beads-sync (enables worktree support)
# - Daemon mode enabled across all worktrees
# - Auto-sync to beads-sync branch
#
# See current config with: bd info --json

sync-branch: "beads-sync"
